NAME

ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS

ls [-alrRt1[-help]] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION

For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For each
operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated
information.

If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are dis-
played first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

The following options are available:

-1      (The numeric digit ``one''.)  Force output to be one entry per line.  This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

-a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).

-c      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).

-d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).

-F      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk (`*') after each that is executable, an at sign (`@') after each symbolic link, an equals sign (`=') after each socket, a percent sign (`%') after each whiteout, and a vertical bar (`|') after each that is a FIFO.

-f      Output is not sorted.  This option turns on the -a option.

-i      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode number).


-l      (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See below.)  If the output is to a terminal, a total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.

-m      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by commas.

-n      Display user and group IDs numerically, rather than converting to a user or group name in a long (-l) output.  This option turns on the -l
	option.

-o      List in long format, but omit the group id.

-p      Write a slash (`/') after each filename if that file is a directory.

-R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

-r      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical order or the oldest entries first (or largest files last, if combined with sort by size.

-S      Sort files by size

-T      When used with the -l (lowercase letter ``ell'') option, display complete time information for the file, including month, day, hour, minute,
			second, and year.

-t      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.

-u      Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).

-U      Use time of file creation, instead of last modification for sorting (-t) or long output (-l).
