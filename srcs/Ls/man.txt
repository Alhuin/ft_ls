NAME

ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS

ls [-alrRtufd1[-help]] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION

For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For each
operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated
information.

If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are dis-
played first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

The following options are available:

-1      (The numeric digit ``one''.)  Force output to be one entry per line.  This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

-a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).

-d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).

-f      Output is not sorted.  This option turns on the -a option.

-l      (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See below.)  If the output is to a terminal, a total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.

-R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

-r      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical order or the oldest entries first (or largest files last, if combined with sort by size.

-t      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.

-u      Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).
